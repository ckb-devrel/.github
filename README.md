# CKB DevRel

Hi, we're the CKB DevRel (Developer Relations) Team.

Our mission is to enhance the development experience for CKB developers while fostering a thriving open-source culture within the CKB development community.

## Our focus areas include:

### SDKs & Protocols

We develop a range of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to make building on CKB easier and more efficient for developers. Some of our key projects include:

- **CCC:** https://github.com/ckb-ecofund/ccc
- **Cinnabar:** https://github.com/ashuralyk/ckb-cinnabar
- Spore Protocol: https://github.com/sporeprotocol

### Documentation & Blogs

We compile, summarize, and maintain all key documentation for CKB developers. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, our Developer Resource Hub is the go-to place for up-to-date guides, tutorials, and technical articles to help you build on CKB.
